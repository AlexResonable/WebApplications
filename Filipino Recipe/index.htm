			<h3>Filipino Food</h3>
			
			<p class="paragraph">
					The Filipino style of cooking and the food associated with it have evolved from its Austronesian origins to a fusion cuisine 
				with many Chinese, Spanish, American, and other Asian influences passed on from generation to generation to suit the local palate.
				Other global influences: Indian, Middle Eastern, Italian, and French, grow familiar as Filipinos come to embrace globalization. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Here are some links for more information on <a href="http://www.philippine-history.org/">Philippine History</a>.
			</p>

			<p class="paragraph">
					Cooking and eating in the Philippines is usually centered around the family kitchen and is composed of three main meals: 
				agahan or almusal (breakfast), tanghalian (lunch), and hapunan (dinner). Snacking in between these meals is common and is called merienda(snack).
				Due to western influence, food is often eaten using spoon and fork. Knives is not a commonly used utensil in a Filipino dining table since most
				dishes are already in bite size pieces. The traditional way of eating is with the hands known as kamayan, where the food is presented in banana 
				leaves, and is done by pressing the rice and the dish together with the fingers and is pushed to the mouth by the thumb.
			</p>

			<p class="paragraph">
					The Filipino dishes have a distinct taste and can be distinguished by the combination of sweet, sour, and salty flavors.
				Soy sauce is a common ingredient and is usually in the base recipe. Another common ingredient is vinegar which adds the sour flavor.
			</p>

			<p class="paragraph">	
					The Filipino dishes may vary depending on the location in the Philippine Islands. Since a dish utilizes the available local
				ingredients, there are may variations of the dish. Some of the dishes like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobo_(Filipino_cuisine)">adobo</a>, may have different versions such as:
			</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Adobong Baka: Beef Adobo</li>
					<li>Adobong Manok: Chicken Adobo</li>
					<li>Adobong Baboy: Pork Adobo</li>
					<li>Adobong Pusit: Squid Adobo</li>
					<li>Adobong Sitaw: String bean Adobo</li>
				</ul>
